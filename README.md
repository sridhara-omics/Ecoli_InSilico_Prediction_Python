# Deep-analyses-of-In-silico-fluxes



The scripts detailed here re-analyzes *some* of the data originally published in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25502413  
Original detailed analyses (with other contributors included) can be found at https://github.com/clauswilke/Ecoli_FBA_input_prediction  
Original flux balance analyses (FBA) work is done in MATLAB. This re-analyses uses python version of COBRA i.e., COBRApy.  
Original statistical analyses (LASSO logistic regression) is done using R. Here, Python's sklearn modules (for lasso and keras) are used.   
NOTE that this is a very brief re-analyses.
Detailed information and modules taken from COBRApy documentation:
